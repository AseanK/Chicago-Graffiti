# Graffiti in Chigago
In this project I sorted number of graffiti in chigago by zip-codes. Then I had it graphed to make it easier to compare visually. I got the data through the MIT full stack development with MERN. I was able to complete the task with using .filter and .forEach functions. I had to change the data file from .json file to .js file.

## How to run
To run this program, simply load the html file on your browser.

## Things to improve in the future
I'd like to use the live info. When the data-source changes, I want this program to update.
