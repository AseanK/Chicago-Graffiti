## Graffiti in Chigago
In this project I sorted number of graffiti in chigago by zip-codes. Then I had it graphed to make it easier to compare visually. I got the data through the MIT full stack development with MERN. I was able to complete the task with using .filter and .forEach functions. I had to change the data file from .json file to .js file.
